 Classifying clothing images into 10 different fashion categories using neural network. For this purpose, I am using Fashion MNIST dataset
 from keras dataset. It contains 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image is 28x28 grayscale, associated with 
 a label from 10 fashion categories. This project has adopted simple two layers network with different techniques to reduce the chance of 
 overfitting (e.g. weight regularization, dropout etc).
